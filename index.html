<section id="transparency-and-openness" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transparency-and-openness">Transparency and Openness</h2>
<p>We adhere to research transparency principles that are crucial for robust and replicable science. First, we published this study’s protocol as a registered report (International Registered Report Identifier [IRRID]: DERR1-10.2196/29563) during the initial enrollment of pilot participants <span class="citation" data-cites="moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021">(<a href="#ref-moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021" role="doc-biblioref">Moshontz et al., 2021</a>)</span>. Second, we followed the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis extension for Artificial Intelligence (TRIPOD+AI) guidelines <span class="citation" data-cites="collinsTRIPODAIStatementUpdated2024">(<a href="#ref-collinsTRIPODAIStatementUpdated2024" role="doc-biblioref">Collins et al., 2024</a>)</span>. A TRIPOD+AI checklist is available in the supplement. Finally, our data, questionnaires, and other study materials are publicly available on our OSF page (<a href="https://osf.io/zvm7s/overview">https://osf.io/zvm7s/overview</a>) and our annotated analysis scripts and results are publicly available on our study website (<a href="https://jjcurtin.github.io/study_risk2/">https://jjcurtin.github.io/study_risk2/</a>).<!--data needs to be added to osf--></p>
<p>For transparency, we documented the changes made to the registered report below:</p>
<section id="sensing-data-streams" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sensing-data-streams">Sensing Data Streams</h3>
<p>Our candidate models included features derived from a subset of intake self-report measures, daily EMA, and geolocation sensing data (see Measures section). Consequently, we excluded cellular communication data, daily video check-ins, app usage data, and certain self-report measures. These decisions were informed by (1) our group’s personal sensing work with alcohol use disorder, (2) technological constraints, and (3) the desire to balance feature diversity for capturing lapse complexity and minimizing participant burden and computational cost.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In our alcohol use disorder research, EMA and geolocation sensing have shown moderate to excellent predictive signal (aurocs .72-.91<!--confirm claire auroc-->) <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2024 wyantForecastingRiskAlcoholunderreview">(<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2024" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-wyantForecastingRiskAlcoholunderreview" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., under review</a>, <!--Cite claire gps paper-->)</span>. Cellular communication sensing, however, has fallen short of these thresholds<!--meta paper-->. Moreover, Apple places strict restrictions on app access to communications, meaning inclusion of these features would result in a model that could only be deployed within an Android operating system.</p></li>
<li><p>We discontinued collecting daily video check-ins about 6 months into the 2.5 year data collection due to technical issues and App usage data (beyond the required study tasks) were generally sparse and inconsistent across participants.</p></li>
<li><p>Self-report measures can substantially increase data collection burden and expand the feature space. Therefore, we opted to not include all measures. Monthly surveys were lengthy (20–30 minutes) and, based on our work with alcohol use disorder, added no incremental predictive value beyond the dynamic sensing data. However, individual differences in severity of use and stability of recovery at the time of intake have demonstrated some predictive signal. Key demographic variables known to influence OUD treatment access and clinical outcomes are also important to reduce model bias by preventing these effects being encoded into the model indirectly by proxy variables. See Measures section for a comprehensive list of all retained self-report items.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="resampling-method" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="resampling-method">Resampling Method</h3>
<p>Our initial protocol proposed repeated cross-validation for model selection and a single held-out test set for evaluation. Although we nearly reached our recruitment goal (N = 451/480), the number of participants with usable data was much lower (N = 300). To maximize data use, we eliminated the held-out test set and increased repetitions in our cross-validation to mitigate optimization bias and provide generalizable performance estimates.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="participants" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participants">Participants</h2>
<p>We recruited 451 participants in early recovery from opioid use disorder from across the United States. We recruited through national digital advertising and collaborations with treatment providers at MOUD clinics. Our recruitment strategy was designed to create a diverse sample with respect to demographics (gender, age, race, and ethnicity), and geographic location (urban and rural). We required participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>were age 18 or older,</li>
<li>could read, write, and speak in English,</li>
<li>were enrolled in and adherent with an MOUD program for at least 1 month but no longer than 12 months, and</li>
<li>had an Android smartphone with an active cellular plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>We did not exclude participants for comorbid substance use or other psychiatric disorders. Participants were compensated up to $75 per month for completing study tasks (i.e., EMAs, monthly surveys and sharing sensing data) and were paid $50 per month to offset the cost of maintaining a cellphone plan.</p>
</section>
<section id="procedure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<p>Participants completed three video or phone visits over approximately 12 months. During the enrollment visit, study staff obtained written informed consent and collected demographic information. They then walked participants through how to download the Smart Technology for Addiction Recovery (STAR) study app, provided a set of video tutorials to learn how to use the app, and instructed participants to complete the intake survey within the app. The STAR app was developed with the UW Madison Center for Health Enhancement Systems Studies (CHESS) and used for all data collection. Within the app participants could control their data sharing options, monitor completed study tasks, receive reminder notifications about tasks, message staff, and access CHESS’s suite of resources and tools for people in recovery from AUD. Enrolled participants met with study staff 1 week later to troubleshoot technical issues. At the end of the study enrollment period participants met briefly with study staff for a debriefing session. While on study, participants were expected to complete daily EMA, monthly surveys, and share geolocation sensing data. Other sensing data streams (i.e., daily video check-ins, cellular communications, and app usage data) were collected as part of the parent grant’s aims (NIDA R01 DA047315). All procedures were approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Institutional Review Board (Study #2019-0656).</p>

<section id="measures" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measures">Measures</h2>
<section id="individual-differences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individual-differences">Individual Differences</h3>
<p>We collected self-report information about demographics (age, gender, orientation, race, ethnicity, education, and income). Zip codes from participants’ reported home addresses were matched to Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes to identify whether individuals resided in rural or urban areas <!--cite[@RuralUrbanCommutingArea]-->. We followed guidelines from the United States Health Resources and Services Administration and define urban as an area where the primary commuting flow is within a metropolitan core of 50,000 or more people (RUCA code = 1) and rural as anything not urban (RUCA codes 2-10)<!--cite [@HowWeDefine]-->.</p>
<p>We also collected information about OUD history to characterize OUD severity and recovery stability, including self-reported Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition OUD symptoms <span class="citation" data-cites="americanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2022">(<a href="#ref-americanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2022" role="doc-biblioref">American Psychiatric Association, 2022</a>)</span>, recovery satisfaction, motivation, and confidence, whether they intended to avoid using other drugs, perceived efficacy and likelihood of adhering to their MOUD medication <span class="citation" data-cites="moriskyConcurrentPredictiveValidity1986">(<a href="#ref-moriskyConcurrentPredictiveValidity1986" role="doc-biblioref">Morisky et al., 1986</a>)</span>, past month opioid use, past month residential treatment for OUD, past month receipt of psychiatric medication, frequency of counseling sessions and self-help meetings in the past month, preferred opioid, preferred route of administration, and lifetime history of overdose. As part of the aims of the parent project, we collected many other trait and state measures throughout the study. A complete list of all measures can be found in our registered report <span class="citation" data-cites="moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021">(<a href="#ref-moshontzProspectivePredictionLapses2021" role="doc-biblioref">Moshontz et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="ecological-momentary-assessment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ecological-momentary-assessment">Ecological Momentary Assessment</h3>
<p>Participants completed a brief (1-2 minute) EMA each day on study through the STAR app. The EMA became available in the app at 5:00 AM CST each morning and participants had 24 hours to complete it. Participants could enable push notifications for reminder prompts to complete the assessment. Each EMA had 16-items that asked participants to report the date and time of any recent opioid use for nonmedical reasons not yet reported. These reports served as the primary outcome for the lapse risk prediction model. Participants also reported any other drugs that they had used in the past 24 hours by selecting all that apply from a list of substance categories. Other items asked about mood, pain, sleep quality, urges to use opioids, risky situations, stressful and pleasant events, and MOUD adherence in the past 24 hours. The EMA concluded with 2 forward-facing items that asked about participants’ motivation and confidence to continue to avoid using opioids for nonmedical reasons over the next week.</p>
</section>
<section id="geolocation-sensing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="geolocation-sensing">Geolocation Sensing</h3>
<p>The STAR app passively recorded participants’ time-stamped geolocations (i.e., latitude and longitude) every 1.5-15 minutes, depending on their movement. We augmented the geolocation data with self-reported subjective contexts. On each monthly survey we asked a set of 6 questions about frequently visited locations (i.e., spending more than 3 minutes at a location 2 or more times in a month) from the previous month. Participants were asked to describe the type of place, what they typically do there, the general frequency of pleasant and unpleasant experiences associated with the place, and the extent to which spending time there supports or undermines their recovery.</p>

<section id="data-analytic-strategy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-analytic-strategy">Data Analytic Strategy</h2>
<p>Data preprocessing, modeling, and Bayesian analyses were done in R using the tidymodels ecosystem <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnTidymodelsCollectionPackages2020 kuhnTidyposteriorBayesianAnalysis2022 goodrichRstanarmBayesianApplied2023">(<a href="#ref-goodrichRstanarmBayesianApplied2023" role="doc-biblioref">Goodrich et al., 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-kuhnTidyposteriorBayesianAnalysis2022" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn, 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-kuhnTidymodelsCollectionPackages2020" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn &amp; Wickham, 2020</a>)</span>. Models were trained and evaluated using high-throughput computing resources provided by the University of Wisconsin Center for High Throughput Computing <span class="citation" data-cites="chtc">(<a href="#ref-chtc" role="doc-biblioref">Center for High Throughput Computing, 2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<section id="feature-engineering" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-engineering">Feature Engineering</h3>
<p>Features were engineered from two types of data:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Static individual differences in demographic and OUD characteristics.</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic EMA and geolocation sensing data.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>geolocation - within 50 meters of a known location</li>
</ul>
<p>We imputed missing data using median imputation for numeric features and mode imputation for nominal features. We selected coarse median/mode methods for handling missing data due to the computational costs associated with more advanced forms of imputation (e.g., KNN imputation, multiple imputation). Importantly, our imputation calculations are done using only held-in data and can be applied to any new observation. <!--Notes from Ross on proposal about handling missing data: 
- Could always include a separate coding for missing (e.g., -99), which could be informative in and of itself
- Otherwise, true imputation would be better using mice - computationally very simple — defaults are linear models
--></p>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="model-selection" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-selection">Model Selection</h3>
<p>Our performance metric for model selection and evaluation was area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (auROC). <!--expand on choice? [@vancalsterEvaluationPerformanceMeasures2025]-->.</p>
<p>The best model configuration was selected using 6 repeats of participant-grouped 5-fold cross-validation.<!--cite and define grouped cross validation--> Folds were stratified by a between-subject measure of our outcome (no lapse vs.&nbsp;any lapse).</p>
<p>Model configurations differed on:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Statistical algorithm (and hyperparameter tuning)</p></li>
<li><p>Resampling of minority outcome. All resampling was exclusively done with only held-in training data to prevent biasing performance estimates <span class="citation" data-cites="vandewieleOverlyOptimisticPrediction2021">(<a href="#ref-vandewieleOverlyOptimisticPrediction2021" role="doc-biblioref">Vandewiele et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We repeated the above process to select a best baseline model that was limited to features derived from individual differences in demographics and OUD characteristics.</p>
</section>
<section id="model-evaluation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-evaluation">Model Evaluation</h3>
<p>We used a Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model to estimate the posterior distribution and 95% credible intervals (CI) for auROC for the 30 held-out test sets for our best performing model. We used weakly informative, data-dependent priors to regularize and reduce overfitting. Random intercepts were included for repeat and fold (nested within repeat).</p>
<ul>
<li>Model contrast</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the same 30 held-out test sets, we calculated the median posterior probability and 95% Bayesian CI for auROC for each model separately by gender (not male vs.&nbsp;male), race/ethnicity (Hispanic and/or non-White vs.&nbsp;non-Hispanic White), income (below poverty line vs.&nbsp;above poverty line), geographic location (rural vs.&nbsp;urban), and education (high school or less vs.&nbsp;some college). We conducted Bayesian group comparisons to assess the likelihood that each model performs differently by group.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gender, race/ethnicity, education, income, and geographic location are used for our fariness subgroup analyses. As defined above we defined urban as RUCA code of 1 and rural as RUCA codes 2-10. Given that there is not a clear consensus on delineating urban vs.&nbsp;rural, however, we also report a fairness model comparison for urban as RUCA codes 1-2 and urban as RUCA coddes 3-10 in the supplement.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="calibration" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calibration">Calibration</h3>
<p>We calibrated our probabilities using Platt scaling. We calculated Brier scores to assess the accuracy of our raw and calibrated probabilities for our best model. Brier scores range from 0 (perfect accuracy) to 1 (perfect inaccuracy). We provide calibration plots for the raw and calibrated probabilities in the manuscript and histograms of predicted probabilities by true lapse outcome in the supplement.</p>

<p>Mean days on study across participants was 298 days (range 32-395 days). 83% of participants (250/300) remained on study for at least six months. EMA adherence was high. On average participants completed 73% of the daily EMA prompts (range 24-100%). Participants provided, on average, 313 daily geolocation points (range 20-825).</p>
<p>Our final feature set consisted of 640 features<!--recheck-->. The proportion of missing values across features was low (mean=.03, range = 0-.12).<!--recheck--> Across participants we generated a total of 88,973 day-level labels.<!--summarize number of observations and participants in training data--> Forty percent of participants (119/300) reported an opioid lapse while on study (mean=5.73, range 0-117).

<p>We compared our best model’s performance to a baseline model that only used information gathered at intake (i.e., individual differences in demographic and OUD characteristics) to evaluate the incremental predictive value of adding dynamic features. The median posterior probability for the baseline model was 0.74 (95% CI [0.71, 0.77]). A Bayesian model comparison revealed extremely strong evidence that the best model was more predictive than the baseline model (probability = 1.00).</p>
<p>Our fairness subgroup comparisons revealed no evidence that performance meaningfully differed by geographic location (probability = 0.68), weak evidence that performance differed by education (probability = 0.83), and strong evidence that performance differed by gender, income, and race and ethnicity (probabilities &gt; 0.99). Notably, our model performed better for individuals with an annual income below the federal poverty line compared to individuals above the federal poverty line, thus favoring the disadvantaged group. While differences in performance estimates exist across subgroups, they are not likely clinically meaningful as all of our subgroups yielded median auROCs between 0.91 - 0.94 (<a href="#fig-1" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>). A table of fairness subgroup comparisons is available in the supplement.</p>

<p>Our raw model predicted probabilities were generally well-calibrated (brier score = 0.015).

<li><p>Discuss contrast between top global features and “actual” important features (i.e., what comes up day to day as being important). What does this mean for how we traditionally conceptualize feature importance?</p></li>
<li><p>When discussing fairness - we don’t look at age. People over 65 is an important group to look at but they were not in our sample</p></li>
<li><p>Decision not include misclassification cost analyses: acknowledge that discrimination and calibration don’t equate to clinical utilility. Decision analysis tools, such as net benefit curves could be used to quantify clinical benefit at relevant probability thresholds. Our model is designed to not be used to make decisions about whether or not to treat but to provide model feedback to individuals each day to help them monitor their risk for lapse. Therefore the decision has already been made to always treat. Should these models be used to inform when to deploy more cost-intensive interventions (e.g., communicating risk level to a therapist to initiate contact) these analyses will be important next steps.</p></li>
